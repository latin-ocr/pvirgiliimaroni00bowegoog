THE POETRY OF THE lurtum. 429

can have but assint idea of them, the story in many other respecto is
of rmanentand universal interest. The broad canvasson which it
iss etched, gave full scope to the learning and invention of the writer,
and he covered it with various and magnificent pictures. The early
part of the poem is the continuation osa narrative, with which the
render of Homer is familiar, and man of the characters are borrowed
from the 'grand struit-gallery of the Grecisn bard. Thus, at tho

to that which charms by the force of old association. The glorieso

old renownof sia andGreece. The uardian deitiesof Troytrans·
firtheir caresto the new em ire, which isto rise in the west. The
commanda of oracles and the litlfilment of pro hecies give new dignity
and religious awe to the course of events. he herois the agent of '
heaven in executing the decrees of fate. llis adventures excite our
curiosity, his sufferings attract our sympathy, his personal plualities com·
mand our respect. As his figure rs the central ons in e pisce, the
other characters being kept in subserviencs to it, his presence alone
gives unity to the story, and binds together the various incidente into
a connected whole. All the events tend towards the completion of
heaven's decree, and the end of the poem brings about the issue, which
was dnrhly announced in thc be inning.

The judgmentof Virgil in scierim his theme is obvious, sor itis
difficolt to conceive of a moro gran and appropriate subject sor aa
Epic. His slrill in executing his taslr is no less remarkable. TheAEne· =
id is the most regular, finished, and uniformly contained poem of iu
class. Itis the perfectiori os art, as inimitable in its peculias sphers,
as the Apollo Belvidere is in statuardv, or the Parthenon in architec-
ture. The llow of easy and polishe versification never cesses, the
command of rich and varied ornament never falls, the narrative and
descriptive perenger are happilp⁷ conceived and intermingled, and tho
charactere and soenes are grouped with admirable sltill, having a proper
connexion with each other, and all contributing to the rogress of the
story. The imagination and taste of the writer are equaliy conspicuous.
The style never falls into bald and prosaic narration, and never offendo
by excessivo or misplaced ornament. The choice and arrangement of
words are so felicitans, as osten to remind the render of a curicus and
tasteful piece of mosaic or inlnid worlr. Yet the composition does not

gesglrindles and sternier the feelings, and the reader is frequently
iiiiiied away 1)] the energy of the style, and the fervor and spirit of
the description. An admirable judge of effect, Virgil never wearies 1)]
monotony, nor offends by sudden starts or forced nans ositions. The
soenes nnd ima es sre litly disposed, to heighten each otberb contrast,
to astonish 1)] 1 eir variety and grandeur, and to plesse by eir vivid·
ness and beauty. The sentiments are dignified and generans, and ore
nobly expressed both in words and action. A profound student of tbs .
human beart, the poet touches the chords of soller feeling, or expresses
the violent workings of passion with equal ower. Moral sufferingis
delineated with touchin effect, and the atriti of opposite emotions, the
