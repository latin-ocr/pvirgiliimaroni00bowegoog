study of the Latin grammar and one or two elementary
books. Cauuot something be done to secure the advanta-
ges, and to obviate the ill effecte, of continuing to use Virgil
as a class-book in the schools? The object of the edition
now offered to the public is, so far as the Editor is able, to
answer this question.

The N otes are designedly made very copious. They are
intended to atford so much aid, that a pupil of ordinary
capacity aud diligenee, who has studied the usual elemen-
tary books in Latin, will be enabled to read and under-
stand Virgil, even without the aid of an instrueter. Iam
aware of the danger of leaving little to be aeeomplished by
the pupil's own efforts, and thereby of eneour ing the
formation of careless and indolent habits ; and lugam en·
deavored to obviate it, by confining the translations to the
more difficult passages, removing these helpe to a separate
part of the volume, and presenting them in such a form
that, although of little service to the student till he has
mado ood use of grammar and dictionary, they will leave
no difficulty in his way, when he has once fairly consulted
these manuale. The eopious materials afforded by the
commentariesofthe old grammarians, and by the rich anno-
tatione of Martyn, Ruaeus, Heyno, and some later German
editors, have been carefully revised‚ and whatever matter
they contain, suited for the comprehension of young per·
sons, l have endeavored to present in English, in the
most condensed form. With the aid here presented, it is
hoped, that the young student may be ableto read Virgil as
a poet, and find pleasure in the taslr, instead of poring over
the work as a crabbed and difficult exereise in Latin. He
will not be disheartened by a continued struggle with diffi-
culties, nor will he lind his interest in the poem eooled by
the perpetual recurrenee of passages, to which he ean
attach little or no meaning. Ile will not be driven to the
secret and indiscriminate use of an entire translation.

The Notes are also designed to point out, in part, the
beauties and defeets of Virgil’s compositione, and to form
the taste and judgment of the pupil, by encouraging him
to apply the general principles of criticism with as little
hesitation, as if he were reading a modern English poet.
Wishing to cultivate the learner's power of discrimination,
aud aware that unmingled praise only inspires doubt, I have
ventured to critieizo with freedom‚ though with a proper
distrust of my own judgment, and fully expecting that the
taste of others will he found sometimes to differ from my
own. Quotations from modern poets have been sparingly
introduced, where a passage seemed to invite comparisou,
iu the hope of stimulating the student’s curiosity, and
of heightening hie relish for poetry.
