· LIFE AND WRlTINGS

PUBLIUS VIRGILIUS MARO.

Aar. that is known witb oertainty reapeoting the life of Virgil may
bs very briefly told. He lived in a brgbly cirilized age, when a tarta for
letters was widely diffused, and notive patronage was bestowed upon
literary men. The oivil history of hir trrne bas eume down ιο us rna
state of perfeot preservation; but biograpbies of its eminent rnen were
seldom written, exeept they were disnnguished for military exploits, or
beld a prominent station in the vernnrent. The eareer of our poet
was not diversified by many remar able events eitber of good or evil for·
tune, and a memoir of him must be pieeed together from carnal notioea
in bis own works and those of his contemporaries, and from sketohes of
re doubtful authority, written in a much later nge. The earliest life
οι ’ ,wbIoh we possess, was written by Donatus,a grammarian of
the fourth oentury3 and this account, though ve imperfect, and
stufl'ed with the most improbable fables, baa furnisbe? the ohief mate·
n'als for all subseqnent bio aphies.

Virgil was born on the sseenth day of October, in the eetn year of
Rome, or about 70 years before Cbrrst. Hir birthplaoe was Andes, a
small village about three miles from Mantua, in the north of Italy. tin
father was of low extraction and employment, but be had reoeireda
small lauded estate through his wife Maia, the daughter of an opulent
farmer aud be was thereby enabled to, give a good edueation to nt·

ιο Naples, wlere he prosecuted hia studies with great perseveram and
ennoean He devoted himself to Greek literature, mathematica, and
philosophy, and thus required the various and accurate learning, whieb
was one souroe of his eroellenoe aa a poet.

It is probable, that he ohose Naples for his residenoe, becauae it was
less disturbed b the oivil wara, that grew out of the death of Julius
Caesar, and whiolr were then desolating the north of ltaly. 'l'bese dis·
turbanees at one time threatened to deprive tbe poet of thermali
estate in land, whiob was tben his sole dependenoe. The triumvirate
of Octavius Cesar, Antony, and le idus, was formed U. C. ⁷11, and,
in the division of the rernment tween tbe aasooiates, Cisalpine
Gaul,as the north of I ywas then termed,fellto the lotof Antony.
Whererer the inhabitants, during the preoeding struggle, had followed
the interests ot* the opposite party, their lands were taken from thern,
and bestowed onthe reteran soldrers. Great distreus ensued, and tha
ancient roprietors flooked to Romaiu the hope of obtainin restitn-
tion of tleir estates by applying to their various patrous. irgil bad
