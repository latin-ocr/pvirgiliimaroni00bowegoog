THE POETRY OF THE AENEID.

Tus object of Epic poetry is to exhibit in verse some gratematio
suchswayasto excite the admiration und delight of the beholder. A ι
story or narrative must, therefore, surm the groundworlr os the poem,
sud it must possess sufficient interest and importunes to analeo curios·
ity and to command our sympathies. 'l'he action οι the poem must bs
one and entire, so that the interest may nothe broken down und sost-
tered among u number of objects und events, having little or no eeu·
nexion with esch other, and thot the mind may rest with satisfaction st
the closo, curiosity being sutiated,snd the various incidente having
some to a marked und natursl termination. All the rules, which eritius
have laid down sor the invention und conductos an Epic poem, nruy
bs essily dedueed from these l‘ew postulates. The peculianties of ths
