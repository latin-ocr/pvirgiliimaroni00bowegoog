In oar common classical schools, too few pupils possess

to understand all the allusione in the text. Tha book is ι
cumbrous one, and they will not consult it ollen enough as

to this edition contein abrief summary of all the informa·
tion which is needed, in order sully to understand the his-
tory, mythology, andgeography os the work. 'Phe merited

In editing classical works for the use os schools, to de·
etde what matter should bo excluded from tbe notes ira

notatione, other things being equal, is a serious objection
tothem. Boys will not read diffuse remarks ou subjecte
that are beyond their comprehension, and will even be de-
terred by their presence from consulting the usesul aud

rectical notes, with which they may be interspersed.
hlluhorate discussions of various readings, or of different
modes of explaining an obscure passage, undoubtedly have ⁸
their use ; but they also have their place, which is certain·
ly not iu editions sor the use os sohools. The show os
learning, that appears in such notes, can be easily made hy
oue who has access to the rich stores os German erudition.
But adifferent opportunity should be sough't sor its display.
ls the meaning os any passage bo disputed, it is better sor
the editor to exercise his learning aud judgment in formio
one interpretation, and presenting it in aclear shape anfi
moderate compass, than to perplex the young pnpil by au
array of different explanatione, and the arguments in savor
os each. ls the tencher who uses the volume should prc-
ser a different translation to the one given, it is all well. 1f
the pupil has ingenuity enough to give another and yet in·
telligible construction to the passage, it is better still. The
practice os leading the notes with references to the whole
range of Latin and Greek authors, and that too for the use
os pupils, who probably do not possess one of the works
cited, and could not read the volume is thoy owned it, is
wholly indefensible.
