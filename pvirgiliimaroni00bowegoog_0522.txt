Tus modern bay pf Naples, named by the ancients the Gulf of'
Cumas. is bounded on the north by the promontory of Misenum, now
called Cape Miseno. AEneas lauded near this lolty point, probably on ,
its northern side. Το the north of Misenum lies thecit of Curuae,
founded at a very ancient period by a colony of Greeks rom hunos,
the modern Ne opont; hence, ‘Eubotcis oris.' Just behind the
promontory, an near the shores of the gulf of Baiae, are the lakes

ucrinus and Avernus, which were afterwards converted into a harhour
by the Romans ; see note to Geor. ll. lul - tor. The former has been
nearly filled up by earthquakes and volcanic eruptiuns; the latter rc·
mnino nearly as it was, when described by Virgi. lt is a small, hut
beautiful sheet of water, nearly enclosed with hilla, which were once
thickly covered with woodo, but are now in part cleared and cultivated.
The most curicus circumstance respecting these hillo, and nearly all the
otherelevations in the surrounding country, is, that their sides are pierced
with a great number of grottos and caverna, some of them evidently
of natural formation, but the reater part dug outb art. Far the '
lar est of these is the celebratetf grotta of Pausrli po, ‹fug through aba
bitias that name, and still furnishing, aa it has aione for at least three

thousand years, a carriage road between Naples and Baiis. 'l'his great·
grandfather of all modern road tunnels is nearly half a milo in length,
twenty-two feet in breadth, and about eight feet in height. Over the
entrance to it, on the side of Naples, is suf! shown a tomb, which tra·
dition affirma, on ood autharit ,to be that of Virgil. The other exca-
vations, particularly those in the hills round lalie Avernus, are much
smaller. They are very long, but narrow and winding, and olleo, at
rome distance from the entrance, ex and into vrnall chambers hewu out
of the rocla, the bottom covered witii a foot or two of water, and show·

cave, through which, according to Virgil, AEneas descended with tha
Sib lto the world of the dead. Most of the other caverna are nearly
chohed up with rubbish, and by the frequent occurrence of earthquakes.
On the summit of the lull, which formed the citudel of cama, Dae·
dalus alighted alter his flight from Crete, and built there the temple to
Apollo, which AEneas visits and examines, immediately aller landing.
A cnvern was dug out beneath it, which some believe to be the lace,
where the Sibyl first delivered directions and prophecies to the ro'au
· leader, the grot itself being used as the ‘adytum ¹ of the temple. his
place is now chohed up wath ruins, and lleyne mainarius, with better
reason, that thia first scene between AEneas and the rophetesa occurred
in a cave, which is still shown, further down on e side of the hill;
see line 42, which seems to describe an escavation in the side of a
mountain. It is believed, that this cavern once extended far under

ground, and communicated with theone already described, by thetide

of Avernus: But the subterranean passage,i

it ever existed, is now
filled up.
